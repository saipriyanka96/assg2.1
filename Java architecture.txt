Explain the Java Architecture.

Java Architecture consists of 5 different parts:

1)Source Code:
The programing language provides a series of instructions they 
can use to create the program they want.All the instructions a 
programmer uses to build the program are known as Source code.

2)Java Complier:A compiler is a software that transforms computer
code written in one programming language(the source language) into 
another computer langauge(the target language)
A java complier is a compiler for the programming language java. 
The common compiler for the java is java class files containing 
platform neutral java byte code.

Source code is compiled into byte code when we use the java complier.
The byte code gets saved on the disk with file extension .class.When 
the program is to be run the byte is converted,using the JIT compiler 

3)Byte code:Byte code is the compile format for java programs.
Once a java program has been converted to byte,it can be transferred
across a network and executed by Java Virtual Machine.

4)Java Virtual Machine:It is a abstract computing machine that enables
as a fundamental component

5)Operating System:OS is a OS with JVM as a fundamental component. 
We need the OS for all the things a C and C++ program would. The JVM 
does a few more things by default,but it doesn't relpace anything the OS
does.
